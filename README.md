# üé≠ Interface vs Type in TypeScript: Understanding the Key Differences

> Imagine you‚Äôre directing a movie called **‚ÄúShape of Data.‚Äù**  
> The two main roles?  
> **Interface** and **Type.**  
> Now you, as the developer-director, must decide who plays the lead.

Before that, let's get introduced to the two heroes of our movie.

## üëÆ Interface: The Structured Specialist

Interfaces are designed to define the shape of objects. If your goal is to describe a structure or contract (for classes or plain objects), `interface` is often the best choice.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```
One significant benefit of interfaces is **declaration merging**, which allows extending the same interface across multiple declarations.

```ts
interface User {
  email: string;
}
// Now User has: name, age, and email
```
This makes interfaces ideal for working with public APIs or extending third-party types.

## üß™ Type: The Flexible Typist

The `type` in TypeScript is all about flexibility and advanced type modeling. It allows you to:

- Define unions and intersections

- Compose complex types

- Represent primitives, tuples, and more

```ts
// Type Alias: Just giving a name to a type
type Status = "active" | "inactive"; // union of string literals

// Type Alias: Defining basic user info
type BasicInfo = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

// Type Alias: Defining contact info
type ContactInfo = {
  email: string;
  phone?: string; // optional
};

// Union Type: A user can be either a normal user or an admin
type Role = "user" | "admin"; // union type

// Intersection Type: Combining multiple types into one
type User = BasicInfo & ContactInfo & {
  role: Role;
  status: Status;
};

// Now use the User type
const user1: User = {
  name: "Amy",
  age: 22,
  email: "amy@example.com",
  role: "admin",
  status: "active"
  // phone is optional
};

```
Unlike `interface`, the `type` keyword in TypeScript offers more flexibility, especially when working with non-object types such as primitives, unions, intersections, or tuples.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Interface vs Type: Quick Comparison

### üîπ 1. Interface:

- Used to define the shape of an object (structure).

- Works naturally with `class`, ideal for object-oriented programming (OOP).

- Supports declaration merging, multiple interfaces with the same name combine automatically.

- Can be extended using the `extends` keyword.

- Best suited for public APIs or when building reusable object contracts.

- Limited when it comes to defining unions, primitives, or tuples.

### üîπ 2. Type:

- Can define not only object shapes, but also unions, intersections, primitives, tuples, and more.

- Great for composing complex types or combining multiple types into one.

- Does not support declaration merging.

- Uses `&` (intersection) and `|` (union) for combining types.

- Offers more flexibility than `interface` in many advanced type scenarios.

- Can be used with classes, but feels less intuitive than `interface`.

## When Should You Use What?

### Use `interface` when:

- We're defining the structure of an object.

- We're working with class-based systems.

- We need to extend or merge types across files/modules.

### Use `type` when:

- We need to create unions, intersections, or complex compositions.

- We're working with non-object types like tuples, string literals, or functions.

- We need more advanced or flexible type modeling.

## üé¨ Final Scene: Whom to Choose, Whom to Let Go?

Inspector `Interface` and Technician `Type` ‚Äî both are essential.
They‚Äôre not competitors ‚Äî they‚Äôre collaborators.
Understand your task, and cast the right character in the right role.
